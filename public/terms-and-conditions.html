						</p>
						<li style="font-weight: bold;">Dispute Resolution</li>
						<p style="text-align: justify; justify-content: space-around;"><br>
							<span>Third-Party:</span> Any disputes, disagreements or issues between businesses and customers shall be resolved independent of Brinmo or the Brinmo Platform.
							Requests for refunds have to be proposed and agreed by both parties, before we can reverse a disputed transaction.<br><br>

							<span>Platform:</span> For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us 
							(including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, 
							or cause of action) relating to the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had 
							with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through 
							binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. 
							As used in this Section, "we" and "us" mean Brinmo and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns 
							and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, "we" and "us" 
							include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well 
							as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any 
							controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.
							Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be 
							conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act with substantial experience 
							in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in 
							writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act’s Commercial Arbitration Rules 
							and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, 
							the "Rules and Procedures").<br>
							You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are giving up your right to go 
							to court to assert or defend your rights except for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality 
							of your residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in 
							that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in 
							federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your 
							residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive 
							personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose. A request 
							for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate. 
							Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the 
							arbitration procedures may be simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrators’ decisions are as 
							enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. You and we must abide by the following rules: 
							<br>1. ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR 
							CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; 
							<br>2. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A 
							REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; 
							<br>3. in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the 
							costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the 
							arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; 
							<br>4. we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs 
							of the arbitration; 
							<br>5. the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; 
							<br>6. the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any 
							arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; 
							<br>7. subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or 
							individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; 
							<br>8. each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the 
							prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses 
							to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.
							<br>This Section will survive termination of your Brinmo Account and these Terms as well as any voluntary payment 
							of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) of this Section 
							(prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, 
							unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration 
							provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, 
							or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (1) or (2) of this Section is found to be invalid, 
							unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will 
							be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be 
							exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal 
							judicial district of your residence.
						</p>
						<li style="font-weight: bold;">General</li>
						<p style="text-align: justify; justify-content: space-around;">
							Brinmo reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you only 
							upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Brinmo reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the 
							hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of 
							the Brinmo Platform after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.<br><br>
							These Terms are made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 
							without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

						</p>
						<li style="font-weight: bold;">Dispute Resolution</li>
						<p style="text-align: justify; justify-content: space-around;"><br>
							<span>Third-Party:</span> Any disputes, disagreements or issues between businesses and customers shall be resolved independent of Brinmo or the Brinmo Platform.
							Requests for refunds have to be proposed and agreed by both parties, before we can reverse a disputed transaction.<br><br>

							<span>Platform:</span> For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us 
							(including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, 
							or cause of action) relating to the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had 
							with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through 
							binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. 
							As used in this Section, "we" and "us" mean Brinmo and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns 
							and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, "we" and "us" 
							include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well 
							as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any 
							controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.
							Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be 
							conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act with substantial experience 
							in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in 
							writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act’s Commercial Arbitration Rules 
							and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, 
							the "Rules and Procedures").<br>
							You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are giving up your right to go 
							to court to assert or defend your rights except for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality 
							of your residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in 
							that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in 
							federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your 
							residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive 
							personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose. A request 
							for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate. 
							Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the 
							arbitration procedures may be simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrators’ decisions are as 
							enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. You and we must abide by the following rules: 
							<br>1. ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR 
							CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; 
							<br>2. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A 
							REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; 
							<br>3. in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the 
							costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the 
							arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; 
							<br>4. we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs 
							of the arbitration; 
							<br>5. the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; 
							<br>6. the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any 
							arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; 
							<br>7. subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or 
							individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; 
							<br>8. each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the 
							prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses 
							to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.
							<br>This Section will survive termination of your Brinmo Account and these Terms as well as any voluntary payment 
							of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) of this Section 
							(prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, 
							unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration 
							provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, 
							or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (1) or (2) of this Section is found to be invalid, 
							unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will 
							be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be 
							exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal 
							judicial district of your residence.
